## Overall Features
* It is a single-page web application created with React.js for the client side. Also, it has backend functionality created using Node.js,
  Express. js, and MongoDB.
* Three roles are included in the dashboard panel: admin, seller, and buyers.
* Byers can book items, report to the admin, and pay for their already booked item using Stripe. If the product is already booked, it no 
  longer exists in the products section on the home page and products detail page.
* Sellers can add, delete and advertise the products. If the seller advertises any of the products, then that product will appear on the home
  page in the discount section. The seller also can delete their added products.
* The admin can verify a seller or delete as well as the buyers. Also, an admin can delete the reported items. If the admin deletes the 
  reported item, it will be removed from everywhere including the home page and sellerâ€™s dashboard panel.
* If the admin verifies a seller, a verification sign will appear beside their name.
* Authenticate with Google, Email, and Password using Firebase.
* For a better user experience, I included React-hot-toast, Loader, etc. All the page is desktop, tablet, and mobile responsive.
* Using Stripe for payment systems, MongoDB is used as the Database system.
